Clickbait Title: My greatest achievement in months.

I've been writing a bunch of articles. I'm going to talk about what I wrote and how it felt.

I'm obviously glad I kept myself more or less to writing an article a day. That is an achievement by itself. Making this something I needed to do greatly reduced me caring about *what I wrote* and more just that I got something out. This is good, it means I did not scare myself out of writing until I have the perfect idea.

## The Best
Speaking of being proud, here's the three best articles:

#### [Is Lean about to do the impossible?](https://chluebi.github.io/conundrum/posts/leanforlearningmathematics/)
This one follows my actual academic strengths the best. I think I had something to say to a lot of people and I could cover my opinions with references. It feels the most like something I can package up and send into the world. Or post on HackerNews ig or whatever.

#### [Hey when I get inevitably popular for my great writing ability and someone reads out this article on a live-stream and the live-stream gets distilled into a YouTube video, be sure to watch the video at 4x speed.](https://chluebi.github.io/conundrum/posts/is4xvideospeedupasignoftheendtimes/)
This one was the most success I had in recognising my own behaviour, debating it and then making changes in my life. I was aware of the vague problem, but it turns out that video speedup was the secret thing that had me more addicted than anything else.

#### [Conversation in a Cave](https://chluebi.github.io/conundrum/posts/conversationinacave/)
This one had the most soul in it. When I was younger this kind of multi-layered loneliness was my normal style and I was glad to still replicate it, although I have not improved massively. I have talked about it with many people and I think nobody really got what I was going for, but I know exactly what I wanted to express and I did so.


I will not bother highlighting the worst articles because they are bad for boring reasons.

## Topics
Here's the general categories I see my articles fall into:
- Complaining: 4
- Self-Reflection: 12
- Philosophical Writing: 2
- Internet/Media Sociology: 6
- Technical Writing: 2
- Prose Challenge: 2

The last two categories are ones I think which I have both higher standards and am more proud of. I want to do more of those.

All of the others have fuzzy borders, but I think a lot of them will be some mush of "something is personally annoying me and I try to set it into a wider context, trying to objectively reason about it whilst still acknowledging my feelings".

## Conclusion
Having to write all of these articles was not for free, it meant taking about an hour a day out of my day to do it. This hour could've probably been spent on other projects. I am happy I've done this project.

To anyone else who is doing this, my biggest tip is to not send your articles into the aether of the internet. Not with the goal of getting no interaction or with getting popular. You need people who you already know and who trust you to not waste their time with your articles. Because the big thing about these articles are is that they are going to be a polished, condensed version of some part of you.

I asked the new Gemini to write a conclusion to this, and can confirm the parrot still sucks.
