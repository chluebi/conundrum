### About Me

I'm a Computer Science Student who is interested in Mathematics, Formal Systems, Philosophy, Compilers, Structural Analysis, Boardgames, Education, Genre Fiction, Combinatorial Game Theory, TTRPGs, Linguistics, Jerma, Volleyball, Game Design and sometimes even Computer Science.

This vast selection should not highlight expertise but rather a certain lack of focus when it comes to my interests. Transitively this lack of focus will most likely also appear in my work on this blog.

I am not in the business of making this website a specific outlet for my various convictions, but rather as a creative outlet. This does not mean I have no politics or the desire to ignore politics, but rather just that I am a person who knows how internet harassment campaigns work.
