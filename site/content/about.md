### About Me

I'm a Computer Science Student who is interested in Mathematics, Formal Systems, Philosophy, AI, Structural Analysis, Media Analysis, the Videogames Industry, Boardgames, Combinatorial Game Theory, In-Silico Ecosystems, TTRPGs, Linguistics, Jerma, Competitive Programming, Volleyball, Democracy, Game Design and sometimes even Computer Science.

This vast selection should not highlight expertise but rather a certain lack of focus when it comes to my interests. Transitively this lack of focus will most likely also appear in my work on this blog.

I am not in the business of making this website a specific outlet for my various convictions, but rather as a creative outlet. This does not mean I have no politics or the desire to ignore politics, but rather just that I am a person who knows how internet harassment campaigns work.
