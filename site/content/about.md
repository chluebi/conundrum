### About Me

I'm a Computer Science Student who is interested in Mathematics, Formal Methods, Philosophy, Proof Assistants, Dependent Type Theory, Compilers, Boardgames, Programming Language Design, Education, Genre Fiction, Combinatorial Game Theory, Game Design and whatever I am up to since the last edit of this page.

This vast selection should not highlight expertise but rather a certain lack of focus when it comes to my interests. Transitively this lack of focus will most likely also appear in my work on this blog.


### About this Site

This site runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
I am using a modified version of the [m10c](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c) theme, specific thanks to Github user vaga for making this lovely theme and making it open source.

This site is hosted on Github Pages.
I am currently not employing any external services for analytics or monitoring.
